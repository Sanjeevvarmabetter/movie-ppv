# VideoNFT TAIKO HEKLA L2
#This project is a decentralized NFT video marketplace where users can browse, purchase, and watch videos using blockchain technology. Each video is tokenized as an NFT, ensuring authenticity and ownership. Users can independently purchase access to videos without affecting availability for others, enabling unlimited ownership for a single video. The project integrates a smart contract to manage purchases, access control, and transaction validation on the Ethereum blockchain.
